Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, moment.js, Bootstrap, GitHub, VSCode

## Summary 
Built a simple calendar application using HTML, CSS, powered by Javascript and jQuery. The calendar allows the user to divide up their daily schedule by hour. The hour slots are color coded based on whether or not the indicated time has passed and feature text boxes that are easy for the user to write in and save their input to localStorage. 

## Highlights
* Uses localStorage in JavaScript to store user input. 
* Color indicates whether hour has passed, is the current hour or hasn't occurred yet.  

## Goals 

* Create a calendar application that saves user input and changes color based on whether or not the hour has passed. 

## Learning Experience

* Gained a better grasp of jQuery, moment.js and Bootstrap.
